## About Me: John Oyler

### Introduction & Professional Focus

I am a dedicated Front-End Developer committed to continuous learning and crafting high-performance, accessible, and intuitive web experiences.
My passion lies in mastering core
web fundamentals and leveraging them to build robust applications from the
ground up, ensuring maximum speed and minimal dependency on external frameworks.

This blog serves as a professional portfolio, providing transparent, detailed
case studies that document my problem-solving process and technical decision-making.
My goal is to clearly demonstrate the underlying knowledge required to deliver
clean, modern web solutions.

### Featured Project: New Wave City

**New Wave City** is my current flagship project—a comprehensive local events guide designed to showcase high-efficiency front-end engineering.

- **The Challenge:** To build a fully functional, dynamic data interface (filtering, sorting, searching) without the use of a framework like React or Vue, demanding expert-level vanilla JavaScript proficiency.
- **My Contribution:** I designed and implemented the entire front-end architecture. This includes the highly optimized rendering strategy, the modular ES6 state management system, and the fully responsive, accessible UI.
- **See the Work in Action:** The complexity of this project is detailed in the post: [Link to your first Case Study Post]
